## Overview  
*Proteus* is not just a dating app—it’s an art-driven portal into speculative futures. This web art piece invites users to connect with time travelers from eras yet to come, whose profiles reflect fluid and dynamic possibilities of identity, labor, relationships, and embodiment. Each interaction becomes an exploration of how boundaries—genetic, disciplinary, national, relational, and corporeal—might dissolve or transform in a distant, evolving world.

A **decolonial framework** informs the design and narrative of *Proteus*, challenging Eurocentric and hierarchical paradigms of identity, labor, and technology. By foregrounding diverse and non-linear perspectives, it reimagines the future as a space of plurality, mutuality, and fluidity.

## Key Concept  
Profiles on *Proteus* are designed as narratives of potential futures, embracing the radical fluidity of:  
- **Genealogies**: Where heritage and genetic codes are no longer fixed but fluid and collaborative.  
- **Disciplines**: Where rigid professional or academic boundaries give way to interdisciplinary hybrids.  
- **Labor**: Where the concept of work transforms with AI and post-scarcity economies, redefining value and productivity.  
- **Nations**: Where geopolitical borders blur, and identities become global or even planetary.  
- **Relationships**: Where the kinds of connections—romantic, platonic, communal—break free from traditional molds.  
- **Bodies**: Where the boundaries of the body expand, incorporating biotech, augmented reality, and virtual forms, enabling beings to transcend physical limits.  

Each profile speculates how these shifts might manifest, turning every user interaction into a playful yet profound engagement with possible futures.
